    <h1>What Happens If There Is No Vitamin C?</h1>
    <div class="meta">Ingredient focus • Skin health • Honest education</div>

    <p>
      Vitamin C is often marketed as a “glow” ingredient, but its importance goes
      far beyond brightness. When your body or skin lacks Vitamin C, the effects
      appear gradually — and are often misunderstood.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Vitamin C Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is essential for collagen production, wound
      healing, antioxidant protection, and maintaining healthy skin structure.
      The body cannot produce or store it for long periods.
    </p>

    <h2>What Happens When Vitamin C Is Low?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dull and tired-looking skin</li>
      <li>Reduced firmness due to lower collagen levels</li>
      <li>Slower healing of acne marks or wounds</li>
      <li>Gradual increase in pigmentation</li>
      <li>Higher sensitivity to sun damage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Severe Deficiency: More Than Skin</h2>
    <p>
      Long-term Vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy — a condition marked by
      bleeding gums, fatigue, joint pain, and poor wound healing. While rare
      today, mild deficiencies are still common.
    </p>

    <h2>Can Skincare Replace Vitamin C Intake?</h2>
    <p>
      Topical Vitamin C helps protect skin from environmental damage and supports
      surface-level collagen. However, skincare cannot replace dietary Vitamin C.
    </p>
    <p>
      Healthy skin reflects internal health. If your diet lacks Vitamin C, no
      serum can fully compensate for that gap.
    </p>

    <h2>A Common Misconception</h2>
    <p>
      More Vitamin C does not mean better skin. Very high concentrations or
      multiple Vitamin C products can irritate the skin, especially for
      sensitive skin types.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Honest Take</h2>
    <p>
      Vitamin C is important — but it is not magic. Balanced nutrition, sun
      protection, and a simple skincare routine matter more than chasing high
      percentages on product labels.
